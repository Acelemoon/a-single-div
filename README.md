A Single Div
============

### Whuut

This is a fun, little project to see how much can be accomplished with CSS. Every drawing consists of a single HTML element (in this case, the beloved div).


### Project Details

This project uses a combination of Jade for templating and Stylus for CSS preprocessing.

### Sharing

Copy paste as much as you'd like, edit it, experiment. If you reuse a significant portion of CSS or full drawings, credit would be appreciated, but definitely not necessary! Thanks!
